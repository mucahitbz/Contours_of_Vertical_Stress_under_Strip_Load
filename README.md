This work involves plotting the contour lines showing changes in vertical stress under a strip-loaded area. The area is subjected to a uniform q pressure (100 kPa) with a B width (1 m).

## The formula of the change in vertical stress under a strip load

$$
\Delta \sigma_v = \frac{q}{\pi} \left[ \alpha + \sin \alpha \cos(\alpha + 2\beta) \right] \text{ where } \alpha \text{ and } \beta \text{ are in radians}
$$
